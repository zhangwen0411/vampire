# Vampire
This is the main source repository of the [Vampire](https://vprover.github.io) project, an advanced tool for automated reasoning.
The following is for end-users of Vampire: new developers should read `HACKING.md` as well.

## Licensing
Please see LICENCE for usage restrictions.
Note that Vampire's source includes a vendored copy of [Minisat](http://minisat.se/) and optionally links to [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).
Such code is provided under their own licence.

## Issue Tracking
Please use GitHub's integrated issue tracker to file bug reports and make suggestions for future Vampire features.
Please provide as much information and detail as possible in either case.

## Download
A statically-linked build suitable for running on StarExec is provided with each release; this may well run on your system also.
If not, you will need to build Vampire from source, but this is not too onerous.

## Usage
See the website's [usage section](https://vprover.github.io/usage.html).

## Source Build
Vampire is built with the help of [CMake](cmake.org).
CMake does not run any build commands directly: instead, it can generate a number of different [output formats](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html), such as UNIX Makefiles.
If you are completely new to CMake, there is a [tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/user-interaction/index.html) for end-users.

Vampire can optionally link to a fixed version of the external Z3 library.
If you wish to do this, [initialise the `z3` submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#_cloning_submodules) in the Vampire source directory.
Then follow the Z3 [CMake instructions](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/README-CMake.md) to build the Z3 libraries into Vampire's tree at `z3/build/`.
This is where Vampire's build system will look for Z3: if it finds it, it will automatically link to Z3.

A typical build on a UNIX-like system might look like this:
```sh
# make a clean directory to build Vampire into
$ mkdir /tmp/build && cd /tmp/build

# Configure the build and generate files with CMake
$ cmake /path/to/vampire

# Build Vampire, in this case with make(1)
$ make
<snip>

# You now have a Vampire binary
$ ls bin/
vampire_z3_rel_master_4933
$
```

### Build Configuration
* Vampire can be statically linked, with e.g. `cmake /path/to/vampire -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0`
* To compile Vampire in debug mode, add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to the cmake call.
* You may find setting a CMake installation directory (e.g. with `cmake /path/to/vampire -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/vampire`) helpful.
